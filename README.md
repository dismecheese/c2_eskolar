## üìã Prerequisites

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (LocalDB, Express, or full version)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/c2_eskolar.git
cd c2_eskolar
 

## üê≥ Docker Workflow

### 1. Build and Run with Docker Compose
```powershell
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

This will start both the SQL Server and the Blazor Server app containers. The app will be available at [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80).

### 2. Environment Variables
- Connection strings and environment variables are set in `docker-compose.yml`.
- For HTTPS in development, see the commented instructions in `docker-compose.yml` and [Microsoft's official guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/docker-https?view=aspnetcore-9.0).

### 3. Common Issues
- **Decimal precision warnings:** These do not prevent the app from running, but you may want to configure precision in your EF Core models.
- **Data Protection keys warning:** Keys are stored in the container and reset on restart. For production, use persistent storage.
- **Identity DI errors:** Ensure all Identity services use `ApplicationUser` consistently.

### 4. Stopping Containers
```powershell
docker compose down
```
